SOMEDAYMAYBE: Disable menu options when max (now 1) number of expander is met in add expander
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Fractions for spike duration options (will automatically set underlying duration to 100)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Considder spike/phi to use clock, advance/reset trio instead of clock/reset pair
SOMEDAYMAYBE: pattern selector in Arr for Modx reps. Walk through permutations

SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate option for phasor, where gate durations are relative. 
SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate option for triggered where gates stay active for multiple clocks (varigate???)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Outputlines white in dark theme

TODO: Spike & Bank need Expander<bool> update 
TODO: If no rex is connected, don't print segment
TODO: Make themes Choosable AND preferDark

TODO: Phi modx Glide
TODO: Use dsp::ClockDivider paramDivider; instead of dsp::Timer uiTimer; in all modules
SOMEDAYMAYBE: At somepoint we need an alternate comunication algo, or some cache, or in place solution. Or no continuous work.
TODO: LOWROW JACKYSPACE -7F (change lowrow?)
Modules in the queue:

Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
