SOMEDAYMAYBE: Make a tinier mini knob (for shape/sample delay/etc.)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Disable menu options when max (now 1) number of expander is met in add expander
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE Upgrade to d3 flame graph
TODO: Themes: light and dark


MAYBE: have our transform functions return a bool to indicate wheather it was in place or not
Then all same length in/out transforms can be in place



Modules in the queue:

flamx: 
- Phi more trigouts
- Spike Spit gates
Eachx:
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
tiex
- Phi connect transitions
- Spike connect gates (even when gate duration < 100)
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)
Maybe:
- Phi (pick from another pos)
- Spike chances it triggers

Expandables???
Route? I guess thru is route?

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
