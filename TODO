SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Considder spike/phi to use clock, advance/reset even when using phasor

SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate length option for phasor, where gate durations are relative. 
SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate option for triggered where gates stay active for multiple clocks (varigate???)

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Gate duration in spike longer than 100%? (varigate)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: make reps increase/decrease speed use Tie
SOMEDAYMAYBE: ModX into Spike option to set +1, 0, -1 option for gate 100% if glide

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://github.com/bkille/BitLib/tree/master/include/bitlib/bitlib.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Bitmagic? https://github.com/tlk00/BitMagic
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Finish debugx (including text and bools?)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: rate divider for readvoltages and dirtyAdapters, that are also overriden by triggers.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: if arr phi or bank spike, use cable to detect step and update activeIndex for segment: https://community.vcvrack.com/t/can-a-module-find-out-what-other-module-is-plugged-into-it/18449/2
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Copy autosave to ProblemPatches with inputbox to describe problem
SOMEDAYMAYBE: optimize cache by checking seperatly for params and input in needsRefresh
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Add linuxes to synctrayzor for presets and patches
SOMEDAYMAYBE: optimize the portchange to be more precise for caching optimization
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Just intonation scale for Arr?

DOCUMENT the difference between connectEnds and not
DOCUMENT Why clk and next?
DOCUMENT how certain modules differ from some others in the library


SOMEDAYMAYBE: Update Rack to create RackCatch2 (accepting catch2 opts only) and RackASAN.

General:
TODO: Use spans instead of paramiterator where possible
TODO: Move content of Shared and constants to the rights spots
TODO: Replace clocktracker with ClockTimer
TODO: int64_t on windows? (include <cstdint>) (phasor clocktimer sequencer, etc.)
TODO: Refactor:
The input expander part of performTransform should move up the hierarchy.
Remove CRTP layer from biexpander

TODO: Make Phasor time agnostic (remove period/process(time version), and everything period related)
and move that logic to ClockPhasor::process(float deltaTime)
 Now we're passing things around redundantly.


TODO: Enable phase for phi and spike. Just disable modx?

Components:
TODO: Make our switch with a custom themable light
using colored leds and colored bloom

biexpander:


CacheState:
TODO: See if we can add dirtyPorts (for onPortChange)


Crd:
TODO: Disable menu option of negative pulse when using phasor as input

Gmod:
TODO: instead of limit(pulseWidth, 0.9999) make it real with clockpulse and sampleTime or keep a timeSince per channel


Spike:
TODO: Get rid of 0v when delayed gate overlaps next in phasor mode
TODO: Make it work for reverse delays
TODO: Negative pulse reverses
TODO: Make polyphonic

Phi:
TODO: make polyphonic
TODO: use reversePhasor (for also needed for broken reverse glide and such)
TODO: implement reverse glide
TODO: Phi outx compatible (why not)
TODO: Negative pulse reverses
TODO: check if instead of update_DIVIDER we can update only on change

GaitX:

ModX:

Arr:
TODO: Make the snapping smooth
TODO: Add presets

Inx: 
TODO: cleanup the template if constexp mess booliter 

Modules in the queue:

----
Later

Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)
A simple polycnt module with different scale out and or start at 0 or 1 options

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
