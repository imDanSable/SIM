SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Considder spike/phi to use clock, advance/reset even when using phasor

SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate length option for phasor, where gate durations are relative. 
SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate option for triggered where gates stay active for multiple clocks (varigate???)

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Gate duration in spike longer than 100%? (varigate)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: make reps increase/decrease speed use Tie
SOMEDAYMAYBE: ModX into Spike option to set +1, 0, -1 option for gate 100% if glide

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://github.com/bkille/BitLib/tree/master/include/bitlib/bitlib.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Bitmagic? https://github.com/tlk00/BitMagic
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Finish debugx (including text and bools?)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: rate divider for readvoltages and dirtyAdapters, that are also overriden by triggers.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: if arr phi or bank spike, use cable to detect step and update activeIndex for segment: https://community.vcvrack.com/t/can-a-module-find-out-what-other-module-is-plugged-into-it/18449/2
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Copy autosave to ProblemPatches with inputbox to describe problem

TODO: Make our switch with a custom themable light
TODO: Caching doesn't work on outx cut (spike. perhaps phi also)
TODO: Be consequent (decide/check and apply) if the active range is post or pre cut
TODO: Make connectEnds work again with new HCV in phi and spike

TODO: If no rex is connected, don't print segment check if looks good
TODO: Add linuxes to synctrayzor for presets and patches
TODO: abstract readvoltages and performtransforms
TODO: Check for params/inputs not invalidating change for modules

biexpandable is now: buffering, cacheing, connecting, communicating
Needs more separation

Modules in the queue:


Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)
A simple polycnt module with different scale out and or start at 0 or 1 options

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
