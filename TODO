SOMEDAYMAYBE: Make a tinier mini knob (for shape/sample delay/etc.)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Disable menu options when max (now 1) number of expander is met in add expander
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE Upgrade to d3 flame graph
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Arr display for displaying changing value
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Themes: light and dark
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Fractions for spike duration options (will automatically set underlying duration to 100)


MAYBE: have our transform functions return a bool to indicate wheather it was in place or not
Then all same length in/out transforms can be in place

TODO: If no rex is connected, don't print segment
TODO: Use     dsp::ClockDivider paramDivider; instead of dsp::Timer uiTimer; in all modules
TODO: Move Arr output port to bottom right
TODO: Change segment pink to yellow
TODO: Arr ParamQuantity 10/16 displaytext (hover and later display)
BUG: Rex & Spike when no rex, don't uiUpdate from buffer when inx connected
BUG: Related. Rex / inx / overwrite do not paint outside the active range. Have seen it work at some point

At somepoint we need an alternate comunication algo, or some cache, or in place solution. Or no continuous work.

Modules in the queue:

flamx: 
- Phi more trigouts
- Spike Spit gates
Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
GLideX
- Phi connect transitions
- Spike connect gates (even when gate duration < 100)
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)
Maybe:
- Phi (pick from another pos)
- Spike chances it triggers

Expandables???
Route? I guess thru is route?

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
