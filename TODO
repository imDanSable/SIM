SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Considder spike/phi to use clock, advance/reset even when using phasor

SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate length option for phasor, where gate durations are relative. 
SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate option for triggered where gates stay active for multiple clocks (varigate???)

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Gate duration in spike longer than 100%? (varigate)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: make reps increase/decrease speed use Tie
SOMEDAYMAYBE: ModX into Spike option to set +1, 0, -1 option for gate 100% if glide

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://github.com/bkille/BitLib/tree/master/include/bitlib/bitlib.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Bitmagic? https://github.com/tlk00/BitMagic
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Finish debugx (including text and bools?)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: rate divider for readvoltages and dirtyAdapters, that are also overriden by triggers.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: if arr phi or bank spike, use cable to detect step and update activeIndex for segment: https://community.vcvrack.com/t/can-a-module-find-out-what-other-module-is-plugged-into-it/18449/2
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Copy autosave to ProblemPatches with inputbox to describe problem
SOMEDAYMAYBE: optimize cache by checking seperatly for params and input in needsRefresh
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Add linuxes to synctrayzor for presets and patches
SOMEDAYMAYBE: optimize the portchange to be more precise for caching optimization
SOMEDAYMAYBE: 5 Arr quantize inx by default by passing a fn with adapter.transfor(&fn::fn)

DOCUMENT the difference between connectEnds and not


General:
TODO: 6 Check for params/inputs/outputs not invalidating change for modules (like outx not cut) maybe inx not insert

TODO: 3 Inx Module (chrd)

Components:
TODO: 3 Make our switch with a custom themable light

Spike:
TODO: Get rid of 0v when delayed gate overlaps next.
TODO: Make it work for reverse delays

Phi:
TODO: 9 use reversePhasor (for also needed for broken reverse glide and such)
TODO: 8 implement reverse glide

GaitX:

Arr:

Bank:

AND MAYBE move glide to its own and prob reps 
Modules in the queue:
Chrd


----
Later

Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)
A simple polycnt module with different scale out and or start at 0 or 1 options

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
