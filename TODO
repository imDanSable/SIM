SOMEDAYMAYBE: Make a tinier mini knob (for shape/sample delay/etc.)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Disable menu options when max (now 1) number of expander is met in add expander
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE Upgrade to d3 flame graph
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Arr display for displaying changing value
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Themes: light and dark
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Fractions for spike duration options (will automatically set underlying duration to 100)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Considder spike/phi to use clock, advance/reset trio instead of clock/reset pair
SOMEDAYMAYBE: pattern selector in Arr for Modx reps. Walk through permutations


TODO: have our transform functions return a bool to indicate wheather it was in place or not
Then all same length in/out transforms can be in place, And we'll use the bool to NOT swap

TODO: Copy from/to addr and friends
TODO: SPike Modx for phasor
TODO: If no rex is connected, don't print segment
TODO: Use     dsp::ClockDivider paramDivider; instead of dsp::Timer uiTimer; in all modules
TODO: Move Arr output port to bottom right
TODO: Change segment pink to yellow
BUG: Rex & Spike when no rex, don't uiUpdate from buffer when inx connected
BUG: Related. Rex / inx / overwrite do not paint outside the active range. Have seen it work at some point. Maybe I disabled that.

At somepoint we need an alternate comunication algo, or some cache, or in place solution. Or no continuous work.

Modules in the queue:

Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)

Stridex
StepOut+NotePhaseOut+EOC is output expander for phi and spike

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
