SOMEDAYMAYBE: Disable menu options when max (now 1) number of expander is met in add expander
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Phasor Multiplexor
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Fractions for spike duration options (will automatically set underlying duration to 100)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Considder spike/phi to use clock, advance/reset even when using phasor

SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate length option for phasor, where gate durations are relative. 
SOMEDAYMAYBE: variable gate option for triggered where gates stay active for multiple clocks (varigate???)

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Gate duration in spike longer than 100%? (varigate)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: make reps increase/decrease speed use Tie

SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://github.com/bkille/BitLib/tree/master/include/bitlib/bitlib.
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Bitmagic? https://github.com/tlk00/BitMagic
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Use https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html
SOMEDAYMAYBE: Finish debugx (including text and bools?)
SOMEDAYMAYBE: rate divider for readvoltages and dirtyAdapters, that are also overriden by triggers.

TODO: Running phi  clock disconnect sets 16 channels out 
TODO: Be consequent (decide/check and apply) if the active range is post or pre cut
TODO: Make themes Choosable AND preferDark. Perhaps even lazy loading
TODO: Make connectEnds work again with new HCV in phi and spike

TODO: If no rex is connected, don't print segment check if looks good
TODO: Add linuxes to synctrayzor for presets and patches
TODO: Use dsp::ClockDivider paramDivider; instead of dsp::Timer uiTimer; in all modules

Modules in the queue:


Eachx/Opx/Per
 bars/steps
 specify bar (wrangle bitwise through all options given the number bars)
 specify steps (wrangle bitwise through all the options given the number of steps)
- Spike only
Wrangle:
- Algo's like sort (always in place?)
A simple polycnt module with different scale out and or start at 0 or 1 options

Loose:
- CV Delay based on clockperiod wet only like fn3 but for clocks
Dawn Bree but with more steps and a trigger out or gate out for switching and perhaps for phase? Perhaps reversed?
